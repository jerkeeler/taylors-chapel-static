          If you are looking for a quaint, intimate venue for weddings, baptisms,
          memorial services, or musical presentations, Taylor's Chapel may be the
          place for you. Taylor's Chapel is a small chapel (it seats approximately
          <strong>70 people</strong>) that was built by the Taylor family of Baltimore, Maryland,
          in 1853. It is available for events in the months of <strong>March, April, May,
          September, October, and November</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Originally affiliated with the Methodist Church, Taylor's Chapel no
          longer has a regular congregation, but Ecumenical Christian services are
          held there several times a year, organized by the Chapel's Board of
          Trustees. Weddings, baptisms or funerals may be conducted by any
          accredited officiant.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Taylor's Chapel is located on the edge of the original Taylor family
            farm which was bought by the city of Baltimore in 1925 and is now a city
            park known as Mt. Pleasant Golf Course. The official address is:
          </p>
          <address class="text-lg not-italic text-center py-4 font-medium">
            6001 Hillen Road<br />
            Baltimore, Maryland 21239
          </address>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The golf course driveway leads to the chapel and there is adequate parking
            immediately adjacent to the chapel. The chapel has excellent acoustics and
            would be suitable for small musical ensembles.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Due to its small size, the chapel has no plumbing and therefore no
          bathroom facilities. However, a short walk up the driveway brings you to
          the golf course club house (once the Taylor Family home) with facilities
          open during park hours from 9 to dusk. There is also a lunch counter and
          eating area where anyone is welcome.
        </p>

          <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Donations</h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            A donation, which is tax deductible, is requested for use of the chapel.
            The amount depends on the length of time involved, including decorating
            and cleaning but generally is around <strong>$250</strong> for small gatherings and <strong>$500</strong>
            for larger, more elaborate weddings. No food or beverages, other than
            water, are allowed inside the church, but light refreshments could be
            served immediately outside the church.
