        Taylor's Chapel is an historic chapel located at Baltimore, Maryland,
        United States. It is a Greek Revival style chapel located in a quarter
        acre fenced-in plot, which also includes a graveyard, within Mount
        Pleasant Park in northeast Baltimore. The structure is a small,
        mid-19th-century country church, built of stone, covered with stucco,
        painted white, and has a gable roof. The interior features frescoes on
        the walls and ceiling, attributed by tradition to the Italian-American
        painter Constantino Brumidi. The frescoes are trompe lâ€™oeil paintings of
        classical architectural detailing, including pilasters, panels,
        coffering, and ornaments. It has remained completely unaltered since its
        construction in 1853. It was built as a Methodist chapel by the Taylor
        family on their Mt. Pleasant plantation. In 1925 the City of Baltimore
        purchased the land surrounding the chapel and burial grounds for use as
        a public golf course. The site of the chapel and burial grounds was left
        to a self-perpetuating board of trustees. Taylor's Chapel is considered
        the mother church of St. John's United Methodist Church of Hamilton.
