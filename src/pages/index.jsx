          Taylor's Chapel is an historic chapel located at Baltimore, Maryland,
          United States. It is a Greek Revival style chapel located in a quarter
          acre fenced-in plot, which also includes a graveyard, within Mount
          Pleasant Park in northeast Baltimore. The structure is a small,
          mid-19th-century country church, built of stone, covered with stucco,
          painted white, and has a gable roof. The interior features frescoes on
          the walls and ceiling, attributed by tradition to the Italian-American
          painter Constantino Brumidi. The frescoes are trompe lâ€™oeil paintings
          of classical architectural detailing, including pilasters, panels,
          coffering, and ornaments. It has remained completely unaltered since
          its construction in 1853. It was built as a Methodist chapel by the
          Taylor family on their Mt. Pleasant plantation. In 1925 the City of
          Baltimore purchased the land surrounding the chapel and burial grounds
          for use as a public golf course. The site of the chapel and burial
          grounds was left to a self-perpetuating board of trustees. Taylor's
          Chapel is considered the mother church of St. John's United Methodist
          Church of Hamilton.

          Taylor's Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places
          in 1983.
