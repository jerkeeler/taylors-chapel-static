        Taylor's Chapel is an historic chapel located at Baltimore, Maryland,
        United States. It is a Greek Revival style chapel located in a quarter
        acre fenced-in plot, which also includes a graveyard, within Mount
        Pleasant Park in northeast Baltimore. The structure is a small,
        mid-19th-century country church, built of stone, covered with stucco,
        painted white, and has a gable roof.

        The interior features frescoes on the walls and ceiling, attributed by
        tradition to the Italian-American painter <strong>Constantino Brumidi</strong>.
        The frescoes are trompe l'oeil paintings of classical architectural
        detailing, including pilasters, panels, coffering, and ornaments. It has
        remained completely unaltered since its construction in <strong>1853</strong>.

        It was built as a Methodist chapel by the Taylor family on their Mt.
        Pleasant plantation. In 1925 the City of Baltimore purchased the land
        surrounding the chapel and burial grounds for use as a public golf
        course. The site of the chapel and burial grounds was left to a
        self-perpetuating board of trustees. Taylor's Chapel is considered the
        mother church of St. John's United Methodist Church of Hamilton.

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-themed-muted italic">
        Taylor's Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
